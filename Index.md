# Person Finder Wiki #

Person Finder is a searchable missing person database written in Python and hosted on App Engine.

Person Finder implements the [PFIF](http://zesty.ca/pfif/1.4) data model and provides PFIF import and export as well as PFIF Atom feeds. It was initially created by Google volunteers in response to the Haiti earthquake in January 2010, and today contains contributions from many volunteers inside and outside of Google. It was used again for the earthquakes in Chile, Yushu, and Japan, and now runs at http://google.org/personfinder/.
